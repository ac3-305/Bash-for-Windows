To install Anaconda within Bash for Windows

Install anaconda ( I installed anaconda for python 2.7)
https://www.anaconda.com/download/
Bash for windows by default does not come with python. 
You can install it yourself but installing conda will install python for you as well.
If you downloaded this inside of windows you will need to do the following: 
   1. Run bash for windows and go to the folder where you downloaded the Anaconda file.
   2. For me it was /mnt/c/Users/<your user directory>/Downloads
   3. Copy the file to the Downloads folder under your home directory for bash:
        cp /mnt/c/Users/<your user directory>/Downloads /home/<your bash home directory> e.g /home/ac3-305/Downloads
   4. type the following:
            bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda2-5.0.1-Linux-x86_64.sh
   5. Say yes to the Terms of Agreement
   6.When the installer prompts â€œDo you wish the installer to prepend the Anaconda<2 or 3> 
     install location to PATH in your /home/<user>/.bashrc ? say Yes
   7. Type:
           source ~/.bashc
           or restart bash for windows
   8. Type: 
           conda --ver
